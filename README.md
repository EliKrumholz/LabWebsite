LabWebsite
==========

A de-central place to access lab related things.

About
-----
Our lab studies biology. Most of what we do on a day to day basis involves working 
on a computer. We design experiments, collect manuscripts, share data, generate results,
and even sometimes find out something worth sharing! As we have become more reliant on
computers, we have been building our toolsets and finding out what works for us. 

We have found lots of great software that we love and use everyday. One problem we have had
is that we are all doing this, more or less, independently. We learn to use something and 
we don't tell anyone else about it. Or maybe we tell them about it, but they might not be
into it as much as we are and our pipelines become fragmented and filled with dead ends.

Git addresses some of these issues on a philosophical level. Git aims to provide the convenience
of a centralized repository in a distributed way. This project here will aim to leverage that in
a way which will allow for a sort of centralized repository for lab related things, but still
allow members to more or less do their own thing. 

Starting this project, our goals are initially more or less the following:

+ Decide if git(hub) is a reasonable platform for doing this
+ Discover if there are already projects out there which accomplish the
  same thing (poorly) described here
+ Refine our goals
+ Generate a list of tools which we are currently using and check if they
  have APIs which we can access through whatever LabWebsite will be deployed on.
+ Develop community.

If you have an opinion of this idea, good or bad, let us know! Since this is 
more or less an experiment in and of itself, we have no idea what to expect.
I think the most important thing is that we try and find out. Guidelines for
contributing right now are simply through the 'Issues' feature on github.
